And the evening and the morning were the first day.\\nAnd God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the\\nwaters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\\nAnd God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were\\nunder the firmament from the waters which were above the\\nfirmame and it was so.\\nAnd God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the\\nmorning were the second day.\\nAnd God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered\\ntogether unto one place, and let the dry land appe and it\\nwas so.\\nAnd God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together\\nof the waters called he Se and God saw that it was good.\\nAnd God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb\\nyielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his\\nkind, whose seed is in itself, upon the ear and it was so.\\nAnd the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed\\nafter his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in\\nitself, after his ki and God saw that it was good.\\nAnd the evening and the morning were the third day.\\nAnd God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the\\nheaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for\\nsigns, and for seasons, and for days, and yea\\nAnd let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to\\ngive light upon the ear and it was so.\\nAnd God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the\\nday, and the lesser light to rule the nig he made the stars\\nalso.\\nAnd God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light\\nupon the earth,\\nAnd to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the\\nlight from the darkne and God saw that it was good.\\nAnd the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\\nAnd God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving\\ncreature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth\\nin the open firmament of heaven.\\nAnd God created great whales, and every living creature that\\nmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their\\nkind, and every winged fowl after his ki and God saw that\\nit was good.\\nAnd God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and\\nfill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the\\nearth.\\nAnd the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\\nAnd God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature\\nafter his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the\\nearth after his ki and it was so.\\nAnd God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle\\nafter their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth\\nafter his ki and God saw that it was good.\\nAnd God said, Let us make man in our image, after our\\nlikene and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,\\nand over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over\\nall the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth\\nupon the earth.\\nSo God created man in his own image, in the image of God\\ncreated he him; male and female created he them.\\nAnd God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and\\nmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue  and have\\ndominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the\\nair, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\\nAnd God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing\\nseed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,\\nin the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it\\nshall be for meat.\\nAnd to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,\\nand to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there\\nis life, I have given every green herb for me and it was\\nso.\\nAnd God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was\\nvery good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\\nThus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host\\nof them.\\nAnd on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;\\nand he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he\\nhad made.\\nAnd God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because\\nthat in it he had rested from all his work which God created\\nand made.\\nThese are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when\\nthey were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth\\nand the heavens,\\nAnd every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and\\nevery herb of the field before it gr for the LORD God had\\nnot caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man\\nto till the ground.\\nBut there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole\\nface of the ground.\\nAnd the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and\\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became\\na living soul.\\nAnd the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there\\nhe put the man whom he had formed.\\nAnd out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree\\nthat is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of\\nlife also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of\\nknowledge of good and evil.\\nAnd a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from\\nthence it was parted, and became into four heads.\\nThe name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth\\nthe whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;\\nAnd the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the\\nonyx stone.\\nAnd the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that\\ncompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.\\nAnd the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which\\ngoeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is\\nEuphrates.\\nAnd the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of\\nEden to dress it and to keep it.\\nAnd the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of\\nthe garden thou mayest freely e\\nBut of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt\\nnot eat of  for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou\\nshalt surely die.\\nAnd the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be\\nalone; I will make him an help meet for him.\\nAnd out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the\\nfield, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam\\nto see what he would call th and whatsoever Adam called\\nevery living creature, that was the name thereof.\\nAnd Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,\\nand to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not\\nfound an help meet for him.\\nAnd the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he\\nsle and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh\\ninstead thereof;\\nAnd the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a\\nwoman, and brought her unto the man.\\nAnd Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my\\nfle she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of\\nMan.\\nTherefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and\\nshall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh.\\nAnd they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not\\nashamed.\\nNow the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field\\nwhich the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,\\nhath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\\nAnd the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit\\nof the trees of the gard\\nBut of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the\\ngarden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall\\nye touch it, lest ye die.\\nAnd the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:\\nFor God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your\\neyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good\\nand evil.\\nAnd when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and\\nthat it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to\\nmake one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and\\ngave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.\\nAnd the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they\\nwere naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made\\nthemselves aprons.\\nAnd they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden\\nin the cool of the d and Adam and his wife hid themselves\\nfrom the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the\\ngarden.\\nAnd the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where\\nart thou?\\nAnd he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was\\nafraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\\nAnd he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou\\neaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou\\nshouldest not eat?\\nAnd the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,\\nshe gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\\nAnd the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou\\nhast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I\\ndid eat.\\nAnd the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done\\nthis, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast\\nof the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt\\nthou eat all the days of thy li\\nAnd I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between\\nthy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou\\nshalt bruise his heel.\\nUnto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and\\nthy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and\\nthy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over\\nthee.\\nAnd unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the\\nvoice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I\\ncommanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of  cursed is\\nthe ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all\\nthe days of thy life;\\nThorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and\\nthou shalt eat the herb of the field;\\nIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou\\nreturn unto the ground; for out of it wast thou tak for\\ndust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\\nAnd Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the\\nmother of all living.\\nUnto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of\\nskins, and clothed them.\\nAnd the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,\\nto know good and ev and now, lest he put forth his hand,\\nand take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ev\\nTherefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,\\nto till the ground from whence he was taken.\\nSo he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the\\ngarden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned\\nevery way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\\nAnd Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,\\nand said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.\\nAnd she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of\\nsheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\\nAnd in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of\\nthe fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.\\nAnd Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and\\nof the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to\\nhis offeri\\nBut unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain\\nwas very wroth, and his countenance fell.\\nAnd the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is\\nthy countenance fallen?\\nIf thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou\\ndoest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be\\nhis desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\\nAnd Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,\\nwhen they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel\\nhis brother, and slew him.\\nAnd the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he\\nsaid, I know n Am I my brother's keeper?\\nAnd he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's\\nblood crieth unto me from the ground.\\nAnd now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her\\nmouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;\\nWhen thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield\\nunto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou\\nbe in the earth.\\nAnd Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I\\ncan bear.\\nBehold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the\\nearth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a\\nfugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to\\npass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.\\nAnd the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,\\nvengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a\\nmark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\\nAnd Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in\\nthe land of Nod, on the east of Eden.\\nAnd Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and\\nhe builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the\\nname of his son, Enoch.\\nAnd unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and\\nMehujael begat Methusa and Methusael begat Lamech.\\nAnd Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was\\nAdah, and the name of the other Zillah.\\nAnd Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in\\ntents, and of such as have cattle.\\nAnd his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all\\nsuch as handle the harp and organ.\\nAnd Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every\\nartificer in brass and ir and the sister of Tubalcain was\\nNaamah.\\nAnd Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my\\nvoice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my spee for I have\\nslain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\\nIf Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and\\nsevenfold.\\nAnd Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called\\nhis name Se For God, said she, hath appointed me another\\nseed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.\\nAnd to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called\\nhis name En then began men to call upon the name of the\\nLORD.\\nThis is the book of the generations of Adam.
